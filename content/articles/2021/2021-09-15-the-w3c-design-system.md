The [World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/) is a collection of member organizations and staff, founded and led by the man who literally invented the web, [Tim Berners-Lee](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/). They work to develop web standards, and ensure that the web is an open platform that works for everyone on every device.

This week, they unveiled [their new design system](https://design-system.w3.org/), available for public use and built in conjunction [with Studio 24](https://www.studio24.net/).

The system is a dramatic visual improvement over their old design, with more readable typography and a pleasing color palette. There is, of course, a strong focus on accessibility, and in particular, showcasing how accessibility doesn't have to be boring or ugly.

The system makes heavy use of my friend [Andy Bell's CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/) methodology. The JavaScript architecture was influenced by [how I structure my own code](/how-i-structure-my-vanilla-js-projects/) (_**full disclosure:** one of my students worked on this project_).

There are lots of smart Sass variables (if that's your thing), well structured markup, and absolutely fantastic documentation.
