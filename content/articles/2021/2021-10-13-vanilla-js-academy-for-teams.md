Two years ago, I launched a project-based online JavaScript workshop call the [Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com).

I'd heard from so many people who understood the basics of JS, but struggled to put this pieces together to build actual projects. The program was specifically designed to help students get better at that, and learn how to use JavaScript to solve problems.

It quickly became my most popular product.

Over 600 people have attended the Vanilla JS Academy in the last two years. Many of them liked the experience so much they came back and took it again. Some people recommended the program to their friends and coworkers.

**Starting today, I'm offering a new way for teams to learn JavaScript: [Academy for Teams](https://vanillajsacademy.com/teams).**

<p class="margin-bottom-small">This is the same program as the public workshop, with some added benefits:</p>

- **Private & Team Focused.** Only members of your team are in the program, so I can really focus on the unique challenges facing your organization during office hours.
- **Flexible Scheduling.** The program start date and office hours can be tailored to the needs of your team.
- **Extra Support.** I can provide additional office hours sessions, more learning resources, and post-training support to maximize your ROI.

_Academy for Teams_ is the perfect JavaScript training program for remote and distributed teams. It's designed to fit around your team's schedule and promote deeper learning and retention.

**If you're interested, [you can learn more here](https://vanillajsacademy.com/teams).** And if you've already attended Academy in the past, let me know and I'll extend a special discount for you and your team.
