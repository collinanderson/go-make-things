Two quick updates today...

1. I recently had the pleasure of [chatting with Jeremy Wagner](https://vanillajspodcast.com/responsible-js-with-jeremy-wagner/) about his new book, [Responsible JS](https://responsiblejs.dev/). You can listen on [the Vanilla JS Podcast](https://vanillajspodcast.com/responsible-js-with-jeremy-wagner/).
2. Today at 12pm US Eastern, I'll be teaching Alex from Frontend Horse [how to build a JavaScript library from scratch](https://frontend.horse/episode/building-a-javascript-library-from-scratch). This one is going to be a lot of fun!
