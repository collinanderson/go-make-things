Over the last few weeks, I got to chat with a bunch of awesome people on a variety of podcasts. If you wanted to give any of them a listen, here they are:

- I talked to KBall at [JS Party about shipping less JS, closer to user](https://changelog.com/jsparty/199).
- On [Greater Than Code, we talked about unbreaking the web](https://www.greaterthancode.com/unbreaking-the-web). This was supposed to be about dev tooling but kind of morphed into a chat about privacy stuff (which I'm wildly unqualified to speak about but feel strongly about).
- And if you wanted to hear more about the business end of things, I joined my friend Philip Morgan on [The Self-Made Expert Podcast to talk about Go Make Things](https://philipmorganconsulting.com/podcast/tsme-156-chris-ferdinandi/) and becoming "the vanilla JS guy."

Happy listening!
