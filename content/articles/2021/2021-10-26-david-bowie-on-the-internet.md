A friend of mine shared [this video of David Bowie from 1999 discussing the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPpiYG9_058), and the unimaginable impact it would have on society.

If you were around then, and you had the pleasure of connecting to the web on a dial-up modem, you might remember what a silly and magical thing the web was. I can remember older people telling me it was "just a fad" while thinking "this is the future."

I'm pretty sure Bowie was a time traveling alien.
