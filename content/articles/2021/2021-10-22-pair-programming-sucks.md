Josh Branchaud wrote [a great thread on Twitter last week about pair programming](https://twitter.com/jbrancha/status/1250463240586395648).

Josh also goes on to talk about hubris and perfectionism. It's a good thread, filled with lots of good points. I don't disagree with him.

But...

## I hate pair programming with a passion

I love the idea of getting feedback on my code and having someone ask questions about it. I absolutely hate doing it by coding live _with_ someone else.

I have ADHD. It takes _a lot_ of effort to get myself into a zone. Once I'm there, I'm wildly productive. But if I get interrupted, I lose all of that momentum, and it takes a lot of effort to get it back.

Pair programming? It's literally constant interruptions and distractions that keep me from ever getting in the zone, let alone maintaining it.

I don't like it in a mentor/driver seat role either. It's boring AF. I don't mean that in an arrogant. I mean that it just literally doesn't stimulate enough dopamine production to maintain my focus.

## So if not pair programming, then what?

I like tight cycles of coding, review, and feedback. Write code, push it up to git, have someone else give you feedback. 

I like it even better when it's framed with specific questions or areas you're unsure about. I like it best of all when it's asynchronous.

And if pair programming works well for you, by all means, do it! I know plenty of folks who get a lot of value out of it.

Pair programming doesn't literally suck, but it does suck _for me_.
