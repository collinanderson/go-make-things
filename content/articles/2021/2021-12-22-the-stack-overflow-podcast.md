The other day, I had the pleasure of [chatting with the Stack Overflow team](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/12/21/podcast-402-teaching-developers-about-the-most-lightweight-web-framework-around-vanillajs/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=so-podcast&utm_content=pod402) about the challenges of learning how to code, and why focusing on the fundamentals is often (but not always) a good place to start.

We talked about the difficulty with knowing where to start, "the experts dilemma," and more!
