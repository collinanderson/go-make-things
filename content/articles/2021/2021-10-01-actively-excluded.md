It may seem like a little thing, but to be honest, this reframing matters a lot.

A lot of folks justify _male-dominated_ industries by saying bullshit like "women just aren't as interested in STEM" or "men are just better at coding." [It allows very smart idiots to justify sexism and racism with "science."](https://gizmodo.com/lets-be-very-clear-about-what-happened-to-james-damore-1822160852)

I've started using "actively excluded groups" or "people who have been traditionally excluded" instead of phrases of like "marginalized" and "under-represented."

The first two phrases call the situation what it is. The second two sugarcoat it.

If we want things to change, we need to be honest about what's happening.
