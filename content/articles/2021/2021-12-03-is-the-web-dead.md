Last week, I had the pleasure of [chatting (again) with Drew from the Smashing Magazine Podcast about the future the web](https://podcast.smashingmagazine.com/episodes/is-the-web-dead-with-chris-ferdinandi).

Last time I was on the show, I talked about how modern best practices were hurting the web. This time around, I was a bit more optimistic. We had a good discussion about some emerging trends that put the user's needs on equal footing with the developer experience.
