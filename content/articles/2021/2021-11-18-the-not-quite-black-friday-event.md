Starting this Monday (November 22) through Cyber Monday (November 29), I'll be running my biggest sales event of the year.

**You can take 50% off every [pocket guide, video course](https://vanillajsguides.com), and [enrollment in the next session of the Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com).**
