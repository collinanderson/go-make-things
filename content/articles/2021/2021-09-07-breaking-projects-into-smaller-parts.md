A few weeks ago, I wrote about [the importance of starting small](/start-small/) when you're learning to code.

That's all good, but knowing _how_ to actually break a project into smaller parts that you can work on is _hard_.

So many students I talk have memorized a bunch of JavaScript methods and browser APIs, but really struggle with how to put them all together and build a working project from scratch.

And that's why I created the [Vanillla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com).

## Learn by doing

The Vanilla JS Academy is a project-based training program designed to help you learn to solve problems and think in JavaScript.

Over the course of the 10 week program, you'll get access to over 170 lessons and work on 30 progressively more challenging projects. Here's how it works...

1. **Every other day, you get a project to work on,** 1-3 short lessons that provide some background, and a template to help you get started. 
2. **On the in-between days, I share my approach to the project** and some of the common challenges and “gotchas” that students often run into.

If you get stuck, there’s a **24/7 private Slack channel** exclusively for students, and **video office hours** every few weeks.

## Project-based learning

The Vanilla JS Academy is designed specifically to help students overcome the biggest challenges that stop them from learning effectively.

**First, it breaks big projects into small, manageable parts.**

As the program goes on, you'll get better at breaking code into smaller pieces on your own, and be able to work on increasingly more challenging projects.

**It provides a network of support.**

How do you get unstuck when you hit a roadblock in a project? This is where a lot of get frustrated and just given up when trying to learn JavaScript.

In the Vanilla JS Academy, you have a network of other students who provide feedback, share code, ask and answer questions, and provide encouragement and support. You can also join live biweekly video office hours and get real-time answers and advice.

**Challenges build on each other.**

The Vanilla JS Academy takes a holistic approach to learning. The stuff you learn earlier in the program gets applied over-and-over again as the program goes on.

You learn how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript come together to impact user experience, web performance, code maintainability, and accessibility.

With the Vanilla JS Academy, you're set up to succeed from the start.

## What students have to say

I think this is the best JavaScript training program I've ever made, but don't take my word for it. Here's what past students have to say...

## Frequently asked questions

What's the difference between the Vanilla JS Academy and your pocket guides?
: <p>The guides try to cover all of the important details on a particular topic, then walk you through a project to help you remember what you learned. Academy is about learning from doing, and gives you just enough information to get started on projects without giving you all the answers.</p><p>If you learn best from experience and building things, Academy is a great fit. If you learn best by being guided through a problem, Academy would probably be a waste of money.</p>

I already purchased your pocket guides? Will I learn anything new from the Vanilla JS Academy?
: <p>There's definitely some overlap in content, but the focus of the Vanilla JS Academy is on teaching you to “think in JavaScript,” through experiential, project-based learning.</p><p>If you've already read the pocket guides, you'll be able to focus more on thinking through problems and less on, "what method do I need to do this?"</p>

How does it work if I'm in a different timezone?
: <p>The lessons and projects automatically show up in the learning portal every day, and can be completed whenever you want. The Slack channel is available 24/7, and there are people from around the globe in the program.</p><p>The only "time specific" part is the office hours. If you're in a location where you can't join them live, you can send in questions ahead of time. Office hours are recorded so that you can watch them later.</p>

I have a disability. Will I be able to follow the lessons and join office hours?
: <p>Every lesson includes a text-based version as well as streaming video with captions. Office Hours feature live automated audio transcripts. Because they're automated, they're not 100% accurate, but typically "good enough" for most people and conversations.</p><p>If there's anything else I can do to make the program a better experience for you, please email me at {{<email>}}.</p><p>

Do I need any prior knowledge or experience to participate in the Vanilla JS Academy?
: Ideally you're comfortable working with HTML and CSS already. Experience with another library or framework (like jQuery, React, and so on) is helpful but not required.
