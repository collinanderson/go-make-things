Yesterday, I wrote about a new Vanilla JS Academy workshop I'm launching: [Structure & Scale](https://vanillajsacademy.com/advanced). 

At the end of the article, I mentioned that I'm making some other changes to the Academy workshop. Today, I wanted to quickly take a look at what they are.

1. The workshops will be 6 weeks long instead of 10 weeks.
2. Both workshops will run at the same time.
3. A third workshop, Building Web Apps, is in-the-works.

One of the biggest things I've noticed from running these workshops for the last two years is that students tend to lose _a lot_ of steam around week 7.

The Slack channel gets really quiet. Far fewer people attend Office Hours. People kind of get burnt out.

Based on a handful of conversations with students, I decided to reduce the workshops to 6 weeks. This should leave you feeling accomplished and energized rather than totally wiped out.

I'm also building out a third workshop focused on building complex apps from scratch. We'll be building an ecommerce platform&mdash;both a store and a dashboard to manage it&mdash;with token-based authentication, serverless, state-based UI, and Stripe API integration.

The _Web Apps_ workshop should be ready sometime early next year.

As part of this expanded set of workshops, I'll running all of the workshops for a session at the same time, three times a year. My hope is that after you complete one, you'll take a month or two off, then come back and take the next workshop in the series.
