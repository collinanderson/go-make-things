In two weeks, [I'll be joining Alex Trost on Frontend Horse](https://frontend.horse/episode/building-a-javascript-library-from-scratch).

On Tuesday, December 14, Alex and I are going to build a date library that you can use to format and manipulate dates with JavaScript. As part of this project, we're going to...

- Bundle a small collection of helper functions into a simple library
- Add structure and organization with ES modules
- Bundle the library into a variety of distribution formats
- Look at alternate ways to structure the code for different use cases
- Add options and events so that developers can easily customize the library
