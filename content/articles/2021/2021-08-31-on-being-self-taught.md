This week on Twitter, [Mercy Damilare](https://codewithmercy.netlify.app/) (whose looking for a job, by the way) [tweeted](https://twitter.com/codewithmercy/status/1432405053428670467)...

> Can someone make it in tech without a boot camp or internship? A self-taught developer üë®‚Äçüíª

Like Mercy, I'm completely self-taught.

I started my career as a web developer because when I worked in HR, I wrote a blog and started messing around with code to have more control over the look and feel of my WordPress theme. Then I started using some of my new coding skills in my day job, feel in love with it, and made a career jump.

I often see a lot of "if I did, so can you!" motivational tweets on web dev Twitter. And its easy to look at someone's success and think it happened suddenly.

So it's also important for me to acknowledge that...

- I'm dripping in white privilege
- I had 7 years work experience in HR before making a career change
- I have bachelor's and master's degrees (both in an unrelated fields)
- Because of my career in HR, I know how to navigate HR gatekeepers
- I interviewed for 3 YEARS to get my first dev job

I failed so my interviews. _Sooooo_ many. Mostly because, ironically, companies didn't value CSS and HTML much at the time, and my JS skill were terrible.

(_Fortunately, today CSS and HTML are valued more than they were then, even if it doesn't always feel like it._)

I also had a few folks who were exceedingly kind at providing me with feedback on my code, career advice, and more. I never had a formal mentor, and I don't think you need one. But having people who will give you honest, blunt feedback is important.

That's actually why I started teaching JavaScript. I wanted to give others the kind of help I had, and I wanted to reach as many folks as possible.
