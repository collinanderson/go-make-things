Last week, I had the pleasure of [chatting with the folks at PodRocket](https://podrocket.logrocket.com/vanilla-javascript) about both how I run Go Make Things _and_ how I see JavaScript and the web evolving over the next few years.

We talked about...

- Why and how I publish daily articles.
- The importance of community.
- Micro-libraries and pre-compilers.
- Native web capabilities.
- The ebb and flow of the web.
