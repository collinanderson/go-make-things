This week has been a tough one. Socially. Politically. Hate is winning right now, and that fucking sucks.

Whenever I talk about this stuff, I get at least one dude (it's _always_ a dude) in my mentions or inbox telling me to just stick to tech. Nah, bruh, fuck that.

Let me explain...

## All tech is political

You can't talk about tech without talking about politics. Everything is politics, and by extension, so is tech.

The sites that we build are used to spread truth or lies. To share hope or hate. To inspire good or evil. Often times, they do both.

The well intentioned things we make get used in ways we didn't intended. As an open source maintainer, I hate the idea that my code is almost certainly being used to share messages and ideas I abhor.

Algorithms, held up as apolitical equalizers, inherit the same systemic biases and flaws that exist in the people and things used to train them.

> I think those of us in the tech industry need to realize, the tools we’ve built are the weapons they are using to win.
> 
> We’re stuck in an information idealist mindset. We need to become information realists.

Tech is political, whether you want it to be or not.

## Silence is political, too

Not talking about politics? That's still talking about politics.

You're just saying that you and your loved ones have enough privilege to not be affected by things, and that you don't really give a shit about the people who are.

> "never turn on your friends over politics" is a great way to say that neither you nor those you care about have ever been harmed by a political development.

I'm personally steeped in privilege.

I'm white. I'm male. I'm cishet. I worked hard to get where I am (mostly), but I also benefited immensely from fortunes of birth: my skin color, my gender, my socioeconomic status.

If you have privilege, you have a responsibility to use it to help those who don't.

I've noticed that a lot "popular white dudes in tech" are incredibly silent whenever important social issues come up. I'm sure it helps their businesses quite a bit. It also speaks to their priorities.

If you have social privilege, use it. Speak up.
