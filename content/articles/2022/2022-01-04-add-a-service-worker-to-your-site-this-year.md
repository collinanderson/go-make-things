Last week, I wrote [an article for CSS Tricks on the one thing I wish everyone would do to make the web better in 2022](https://css-tricks.com/add-a-service-worker-to-your-site/).

> One of the best things you can do for your website in 2022 is add a service worker, if you donâ€™t have one in place already. Service workers give your website super powers. Today, I want to show you some of the amazing things that they can do, and give you a paint-by-numbers boilerplate that you can use to start using them on your site right away.

The article includes step-by-step instructions for getting a basic service worker setup, and links to additional resources if you want to dig deeper.
