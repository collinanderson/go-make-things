Last week, I quit my job to focus entirely on my JS education business. 

A few years ago, I realized that I find helping others have that "aha" moment, seeing them build cool stuff, sharing that excitement at landing their first developer job... that's _way more_ exciting to me than doing client work.

I've got a lot of exciting stuff planned for this year.

Whether you've been reading for a while, or you just started reading my stuff recently, thank you for your support!
