Last week, I quit my job to focus entirely on my JS education business. 

A few years ago, I realized that helping others have that "aha" moment, seeing them build cool stuff, sharing that excitement at landing their first developer job... that's _way more_ exciting to me than doing client work.

So now, I get to focus all of my energy on doing more of that! ü§ó

## Plans for 2022

I've got a lot of exciting stuff planned for this year.

- A handful of new courses 
- Live streaming events
- A new project series
- More focus on the Vanilla JS Podcast
- An expert Vanilla JS Academy program focused on web apps 

If there's something you're really interested in, [let me know](/about).

## Thank you!

Whether you've been reading for a while, or you just started reading my stuff recently, thank you for your support!

The only reason I've been able to do this is because so many amazing people have allowed me to help them on their JavaScript journey, spread the word about what I to do others, and given me invaluable feedback to help me grow.

I'd also like to thank some very specific people who've helped me get here:

- [Jonathan Stark](https://jonathanstark.com/), my business coach who referred to me as "Oh, the vanilla JS guy!" the first time we met. He planted the seed that started this whole thing off.
- [Philip Morgan](https://philipmorganconsulting.com/), who has helped me refine my positioning and, along with Jonathan, pushed me to start writing emails every day (that literally transformed my business).
- [Kai Davis](https://kaidavis.com/), whose given me countless amounts of feedback on pricing, email automation, how to word things, and more.
- [Paul Jarvis](https://usefathom.com/pjrvs), who taught me that you can be your 100% authentic self, swear like a fucking sailor, and still have a thriving business-of-one.
- [Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com/), who took an hour out of his business life a decade ago to talk with me on Skype when I was an HR guy trying to change careers.
- [Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com/), whose Digging into WordPress series kick-started whole career back when I was just an HR blogger.
- My old boss, Jon, who asked me, "Can you learn how?" when I told him I couldn't build a prototype of this HR learning app we had come up with. That one question changed my whole life.
- [Jen Robbins](https://learningwebdesign.com/), [Christopher Schmidt](http://christopher.org/), and [Ari Stiles](https://about.me/arianne), whose Artifact Conference has connected me with so many people that I still talk to today.

I'm sure there are many, _many_ more people I should add to this list. If you're one of those people and I missed you, I'm so sorry!

There's no such thing as a self-made success. I'm so grateful for all the help I've gotten over the years. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I'm looking forward to helping you level-up your JavaScript skills this year!
