A lot of folks don't know this, but I have a day job. 

[My JavaScript education business](/resources) is actually a side-hustle. It's a pretty successful one, but not enough to be my full-time thing... yet.

**I'd like to make 2022 the year that changes, but I need your help.**

To make my JS education work fully self-sustaining, I need to reach more people. If you've enjoyed learning from me, here are some specific ways you can help...

- Recommend [my newsletter](https://gomakethings.com) to anyone who you think might enjoy it.
- Ask your company to [hire me to run a private workshop](https://vanillajsacademy.com/teams/) or [purchase my courses for your team](https://vanillajsguides.com/teams/).
- Suggest podcasts or live stream shows I should go on to reach new people.

Thanks in advance, and Happy New Year!
