The other day, I had someone ask me if I ever planned on creating vanilla CSS resources.

I've thought about it before, but the truth is, there are a few folks out there who already do that with a much deeper expertise than I have. Today, I wanted to recommend there work!

[Stephanie Eckles](https://thinkdobecreate.com/) is the me of CSS.

Whenever I'm work on a new project, her [SmolCSS](https://smolcss.dev/) reference site is constantly open. She also [writes about modern CSS](https://moderncss.dev/) and shares lots of cool goodness that makes complicated tasks simple.

If you're looking for details on the various ways to layout a page, [Every Layout by Heydon Pickering and Andy Bell](https://every-layout.dev/) is an amazing resource. They recently updated the whole thing, and are selling it for 40-percent off right now.
