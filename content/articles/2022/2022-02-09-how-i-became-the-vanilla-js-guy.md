Yesterday, I had the pleasure of [chatting with Chris Bongers about how I became the vanilla JS guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw0u56LBmSo).

We talked about how I got into web development after years as an HR professional, how I made the career switch, the viability of CSS as a career path, and why I got into JavaScript.

We also talked a fair bit about the value of sharing everything you learn, and the power of daily writing.
