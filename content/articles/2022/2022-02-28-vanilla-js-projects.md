If you need a break from everything going on right now, I just released [Vanilla JS Projects](https://vanillajsprojects.com), a collection of free self-paced JavaScript projects.

Each project is broken up into 3-4 smaller mini-projects that build on each other. Each part includes a few short lessons and a template to get you started. 

Depending on your comfort level, you can...

1. **Do It Yourself (DIY).** You can try to complete the project on your own, then come back and watch me explain my approach.
2. **Code Along.** If you'd prefer, you can code along with me as I walk through my solution.

You can also mix-and-match approaches depending on how you feel about any particular project.

**Grab your free vanilla JS Projects starter bundle at [vanillaJSprojects.com](https://vanillajsprojects.com).** And if you like it, I'd be delighted if you shared with others.
