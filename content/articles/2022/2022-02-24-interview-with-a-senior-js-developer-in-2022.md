Everything is terrible right now. If you need a break, [this satirical interview with a JS developer in 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo3cL4nrGOk) is one of the most painfully accurate and funny things I've seen in a while.

Some of my favorite quotes...

- "Yea, we use React! Well, we actually use Preact. We actually use Svelte. We actually went back to vanilla JavaScript..."
- "At least you know it's bad..."
- "jQuery? What are you, 5? We use JJQuery."
- "It's such a messy language. We use it for our website, desktop app, mobile app, the fridge, the Tesla..."

If you need a laugh amid the sea of awful, [take a few minutes to watch the whole thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo3cL4nrGOk).
