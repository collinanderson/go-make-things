Thanks for chatting with me about the Lean Web. I've put together a *ton* of resources for you on building a simpler, faster world-wide web.

## The Lean Web Slides & Video

You can grab the slides from my talk *and* watch a video of it (great for sharing with coworkers) at **[LeanWeb.dev](https://leanweb.dev/)**.

There's also a free ebook version of the talk, and a list of all of the Lean Web resources mentioned in the talk.
