## How does consulting work?

We start with a kick-off workshop to identify your business goals and challenges, and create a plan to help you achieve your goals.

Throughout the duration of your project, I’ll be available to provide you with the strategic and tactical guidance you need, when you need it. I can:

- Provide feedback on strategic direction.
- Review designs, code, and works-in-progress.
- Recommend tools, approaches, processes, and workflows.
- Share emerging technologies, techniques, and best practices.
- Provide situational responsiveness to related needs that require my assistance.

We'll have regular meetings by phone or video conference. In between meetings, you have unlimited, 24/7 access to me by email or IM.

Don’t put off getting the help you need on your JavaScript project! If at any time in the first 30 days you're unhappy for any reason, just let me know and I’ll refund your payment in full.

	<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This is not a “developer-for-hire” arrangement. I provide code samples and design sketches as needed, but authoring shipping code, designs, and documentation is beyond the scope of the retainer.</em></p>
	<p><em>Consulting availability is extremely limited, and you can be added to the wait list if no spots are available.</em></p>
