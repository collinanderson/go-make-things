## How It Works

1-on-1 Coaching Calls take place over zoom, and entitle you to ask me anything about any JavaScript or career challenges youâ€™re facing. I'll give you immediate advice about what to do next.

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Common areas of interest include...</strong></p>

- The best way to approach a particular task or challenge.
- How to structure your code.
- How to ensure your code will work across a variety of browsers and devices.
- What technologies to focus on to find a job.
- How to find open roles or get an interview.

Iâ€™ll give you specific advice, personalized advice, and share code snippets that you can put into action immediately based on my years of writing code for some of the worldâ€™s best organizations.

You are welcome to record the call for future reference. Once you submit your payment, youâ€™ll receive a link to schedule a 60 minute appointment in my calendar.
