## How It Works

1-on-1 Coaching Calls are 60 minutes long, and take place over Zoom. You share the biggest JavaScript challenges youâ€™re facing, and I'll give you immediate, practical advice about what to do next.

<p class="margin-bottom-small"><strong>Common areas of interest include...</strong></p>

- The best way to approach a particular task or challenge.
- How to structure and maintain code as it scales.
- How to ensure your code will work across a variety of browsers and devices.
- Career challenges like what technology to focus on or how to find open roles.

Iâ€™ll give you **personalized advice that you can put into action immediately** based on years of teaching JavaScript and writing code for some of the worldâ€™s best organizations.

You are welcome to record the call for future reference. Once you submit your payment, youâ€™ll receive a link to schedule a 60 minute appointment in my calendar.
