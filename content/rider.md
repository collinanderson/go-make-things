Iâ€™m delighted that you want to invite me to speak at your event. I love talking with people about JavaScript and how to build a simpler, more resilient web.

Here is what you need to know before you send me your invitation.

## Cost & Expenses

<div class="list-spaced">
{{%md%}}
- I require flight, ground transportation, and accommodation to be covered, as well as meals for the entire duration of the conference, plus an honorarium.

	+ Flights, ground transportation and accommodation: should be booked up front, not reimbursed. If I am booking my own flights, I expect to be reimbursed promptly, not after the event. Please note that I will not fly economy for long haul (> 5hrs) flights.
	+ Hotel: please book a non-smoking room, with good wifi, and have all room expenses including taxes and incidentals covered. I will not provide a credit card at the hotel. I only use debit cards, which means that, unlike a credit card where the incidentals deposit is merely a hold on the card, the hotel will actually take money out of my account at check-in right away, and it will take at least 7 days after I check out for me to get that money back. Whether debit or cash, I need that money to be available for me to use during my trip.
	+ Meals & expenses: some conferences prefer to offer a daily per diem instead of collecting receipts for reimbursing expenses such as meals. This is my preference as well.

- I usually charge a fee to speak. That fee may vary according to the ticket price. Unless otherwise agreed, I require the fee payment to be made in full at least two weeks ahead of the event.

	That being said, my fee is open to negotiation, especially for non-profit, community-driven events. If you would like me to create and deliver a new talk, then I expect to be paid for the time that goes into creating it. I also sometimes waive my fee for smaller events in exchange for covering one or two extra nights in the hotel. In the case I give a talk for free, the talk needs to be made available for free to everyone.
